Our final results for the Sandia Problem. 

Run kd_tree_algorithm.py and select on the main function what STL file and microstructure is desired. 

The output will be a .vti file whose name is given by the user. The .vti file can be opened in ParaView. 

Sample results are given (both .vti files and images) in the results folder. 

We worked on the tube, helical gear, and turbo blade models. We generated 10 different textures for the turbo blade model. 

Our approach is based on periodicity of single microstructures, but we developed theoretical approaches to include multiple microstructures into one CAD model while maitaining smoothness in texture transition.
